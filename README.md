Engineered a robust aircraft classification and identification system using ResNet-50 and YOLO object detection algorithms. Seamlessly integrating advanced deep learning techniques, the system not only categorizes aircraft but also extracts vital information, offering enhanced security measures and detection capabilities
The objective of this project is to accurately detect and classify aircraft in images, identifying them as either civilian or military. YOLOv5 is employed to detect and name the aircraft, while ResNet-50 assists in the classification process. To provide detailed information about each detected aircraft, GPT-3.5 is integrated into the system.
